How to run your own server to my game:

1. Install Python
2. Install pygame module (type'pip install pygame' in terminal)
3. Download the client part
4. Go to the directory you've downloaded server.py and type 'python server.py'. If you get message 'Waiting for a connection' its ok, your server works.
5. Open mp.py in the client part and change the 'address' value to the IP address of computer you use as server. You can know you IP by typing 'ipconfig' in the command line and checking 'IPv4 Address' field
6. Go to the directory you placed mp.py and run it (type 'python mp.py' in the command line). Person you play with should do the same.
7. Enjoy playing
